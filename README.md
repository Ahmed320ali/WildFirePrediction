# Predicting Wildfire Locations

# Introduction
This project aims to harness the power of deep learning to predict potential wildfire locations. Utilizing data from the last 2 years and assume they are synthetic data, the project seeks to provide crucial insights into wildfire dynamics, potentially aiding in prevention and mitigation efforts.

# Objective
The main objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the latitude and longitude of potential wildfires. By analyzing various factors and patterns associated with wildfires, the model seeks to enhance our understanding and forecasting capabilities in this critical area.

# Data Source
Our analysis is based on data obtained from data.gov. This dataset recorded all wildfires that occured in the recent years.

# Analysis Overview
- Patterns of Wildfires: Investigating historical trends and patterns in wildfire occurrences to identify common factors and conditions.
- Attributes Related to Wildfires: Analyzing various attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation types that contribute to wildfire risks.
- Behavioral Analysis of Fires: Studying the progression of fires, including the duration from when a fire is reported until it is extinguished, and how this impacts the size and spread of the fire.
- Wildfires on Weekends and Holidays: Assessing if the frequency and intensity of wildfires change during weekends or holidays, potentially due to human activities.
Deep Learning Model
Our approach utilizes a deep learning model, specifically designed to handle the complexity and variability of wildfire data.
